Welcome to the development repository for the **Nour Alsham** web application. This project is a modern, high-performance digital menu designed to provide an appetizing and seamless ordering experience.

## 🚀 Features
- **Dual Language Support:** Full LTR/RTL support for English and Arabic users.
- **Interactive Menu:** Browse categories including Shawarma, Pizza, Turkish Peda, and Appetizers.
- **Dynamic Customization:** Choose sizes, add extras (like extra meat or cheese), and select sauces with real-time price updates.
- **Integrated Cart System:** A custom JavaScript-driven cart that manages orders and prepares them for final checkout.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for all devices, from desktop to mobile, using a vibrant "food-centric" color palette.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5:** Semantic structure with data attributes for multi-language support.
- **CSS3:** Custom properties (CSS variables), Flexbox, Grid, and smooth animations.
- **JavaScript:** Vanilla JS state management for the cart and menu data.

## 🚧 Status & Collaboration
This project is currently **in development**. I am actively looking for collaborators to help with:
- Backend integration (Node.js/Firebase) for order processing.
- UI/UX refinements and custom animations.
- Integration of a WhatsApp or Email ordering API.

## 📂 Project Structure
